After visiting **Lund** and **Malmö** in southern Sweden, we wanted to explore a bigger and busier city. So we decided to go to **Copenhagen**, the capital of **Denmark**.

### Crossing the Øresund Bridge

One fine morning, we took the **Øresund train** from Malmö to Copenhagen. The train crosses the famous [**Øresund Bridge**](https://visitskane.com/classic-attractions/oresund-bridge), a long bridge that connects **Sweden** and **Denmark**. It’s amazing to travel from one country to another in just about 40 minutes!

### First Stop: The Little Mermaid

Our first plan was to meet **The Little Mermaid**, the most famous statue in Copenhagen. We got off the train at **Østerport Station**, and from there it was only about 15 minutes’ walk.

The statue is near [**Kastellet Fortress**](https://www.kastellet.com/en/to-do/museum/), a beautiful old fort surrounded by water and walking paths. We walked through the quiet park, and finally — there she was!

It was a cloudy October day, typical weather for Scandinavia. The sky was grey, and the sea was calm. The Little Mermaid looked a bit sad — maybe because of the gloomy weather — and it showed in all our photos too!

### Who is The Little Mermaid?

The Little Mermaid is a **bronze sculpture** made by [**Edvard Eriksen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Eriksen) in **1913**. She is based on the famous fairy tale by Danish writer [**Hans Christian Andersen**](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Christian-Andersen-Danish-author).

The story is about a young mermaid who falls in love with a prince. She dreams of becoming human and gives up her voice to live on land. It’s a story of love, hope, and sadness — and that’s why the statue also looks thoughtful and lonely.

### Behind the scene

Here’s a lovely part of the story:
A Danish brewer named [**Carl Jacobsen**](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/175-years/a-history-of-brewing/carl-jacobsen/), who also founded the [**Carlsberg**](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/) beer company, went to see a **ballet performance** of *The Little Mermaid* at the [**Royal Danish Theatre**](https://kglteater.dk/en).

He loved the story so much that he asked the sculptor **Edvard Eriksen** to make a statue of the mermaid. The dancer who played the mermaid in the ballet inspired him, but she didn’t want to model for the sculpture — so Eriksen’s **wife, [Eline Eriksen](https://dbpedia.org/page/Eline_Eriksen)**, posed instead!

So, the Little Mermaid you see today is partly inspired by art, love, and family — a true Danish creation.

### A Tough Life

Even though she looks peaceful, the Little Mermaid has had a difficult life. Over the years, some people have damaged her many times.

* In **1964**, someone cut off her head!
* In **1984**, her arm was removed — but returned a few days later.
* In **1998**, her head was stolen again but later found and replaced.
* In **2003**, she was pushed into the water!

Sometimes she is also painted or dressed up during protests. Still, she always comes back — strong and smiling again.

### Symbol of Copenhagen

The Little Mermaid is more than just a statue. She is a **symbol of Copenhagen** — just like the **Eiffel Tower** is for Paris or the **Statue of Liberty** is for New York.

She reminds visitors of Denmark’s love for art, stories, and the sea. Even though she is small, she has a big place in the hearts of people all around the world.

**Travel Tip:**
The best time to visit The Little Mermaid is early in the morning or late in the evening — when there are fewer tourists. Bring a jacket (it’s windy near the water!) and take a quiet moment to enjoy the view of the harbour.

### What’s Next?

After spending some quiet time with the Little Mermaid, we started walking again — this time towards Amalienborg Palace, the royal home of the Danish Queen. The beautiful palace square and the changing of the guards were waiting for us!
