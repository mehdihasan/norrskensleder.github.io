To celebrate my daughter’s 7th birthday, we wanted to do something truly unforgettable — something that would open her eyes to the wonders of the world beneath the sea. Just a few metres from the Øresund strait in Copenhagen sits a place that does exactly that: Den Blå Planet, the National Aquarium of Denmark. This is Northern Europe’s largest, most state-of-the-art aquarium, and it offers not only an impressive collection of marine life, but also a full sensory journey into the mysteries of the ocean.

## First Impressions – A Building Like a Whirlpool

From the outside, Den Blå Planet immediately captures your attention. Its architecture is inspired by the swirling motion of a whirlpool — sleek curves of steel and glass that almost appear to be in motion themselves. Walking toward the entrance, you already feel like you’re being pulled into another world.

Once inside, guests step straight into the “vortex” — a curved lobby that branches into the aquarium’s three main sections. From here, you’re drawn into a labyrinth of 53 aquariums and installations holding more than seven million liters of water, home to thousands of animals from around the globe.

## Getting In – Skipping the Line but Not the Wait

We had purchased our tickets online, which meant we could skip the ticket counter. However, Den Blå Planet controls visitor numbers carefully to ensure that each guest has the best possible experience. This meant we waited about half an hour at the entrance before being allowed inside. It was a small inconvenience, but once we stepped in, the wait was well worth it.

## Exploring the Aquarium – A Journey Through the Seas

The aquarium is cleverly organized into sections, each numbered and marked with clear signage, making it easy to navigate even for families with children. Digital screens provide detailed information about the animals, and with the press of a button, you can switch between Danish and English.

Throughout the day, there are scheduled activities and live feedings. One of the highlights for me was watching the piranha feeding — equal parts thrilling and educational.
To make sure everyone, especially children, has a chance to enjoy the exhibits, Den Blå Planet has marked viewing spots in front of the larger tanks. Families can stand there without blocking others, and kids can enjoy an unobstructed view of the marine life. It’s a thoughtful detail that makes the visit more enjoyable for everyone.

## Tropical Rainforest – A Living Jungle

One of the most surprising and delightful areas was the tropical rainforest section. It felt like stepping into a miniature jungle: warm air, lush greenery, and the sounds of exotic creatures. Tiny frogs hopped across the pathways, so you had to watch your step carefully. My daughter loved this part, giggling every time she spotted a frog hiding among the leaves. The rainforest also includes other fascinating species, offering a glimpse into ecosystems beyond the ocean.

## The Shark Tunnel – Walking Beneath the Waves

The true showstopper, however, was the shark tunnel. Imagine walking through a long glass corridor while sharks, giant stingrays, and sea turtles glide gracefully above and around you. The sheer size of the tank makes you feel as if you’ve shrunk and stepped right into the ocean. For children — and adults too — it’s a mesmerizing experience, one that inspires both awe and respect for marine life.

## Interactive Fun for Kids

Den Blå Planet isn’t just about looking — it’s about experiencing. There are touch pools where children (under staff supervision) can gently interact with marine animals. For a 7-year-old birthday girl, this was a dream come true — she got to feel the texture of sea stars and other fascinating creatures, making the day even more special.

## A Day to Remember

There are impressive aquariums all over the world, but Den Blå Planet truly stands out for its combination of architecture, atmosphere, and attention to detail. Whether spotting Nemo and Dory or walking through the mesmerizing shark tunnel, the aquarium offers an unforgettable glimpse into the mysteries of the sea.

If you find yourself in Copenhagen, this is an attraction you shouldn’t miss. For us, it wasn’t just a day at the aquarium — it was an adventure, a birthday gift of wonder and discovery that my daughter (and all of us) will never forget.
